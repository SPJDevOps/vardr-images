# Security Features in Vardr Stack

## Enhanced Spring Boot Pipeline Security

The Spring Boot pipeline has been enhanced with comprehensive security scanning and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation to align with DevSecOps best practices and compliance requirements.

### üîç Security Scanning with Trivy

**What it does:**
- Scans Docker images for known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Checks for misconfigurations and security issues
- Reports findings in SARIF format for GitHub Security tab integration
- Focuses on CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM severity issues

**Configuration:**
```yaml
- name: Security scan with Trivy
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ github.actor }}/vardr/${{ matrix.image.name }}:latest
    format: 'sarif'
    output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM'
```

**Benefits:**
- Early detection of security vulnerabilities
- Integration with GitHub Security tab for centralized reporting
- Automated scanning on every build and PR
- Compliance-ready security reporting

### üìã SBOM Generation

**What is SBOM?**
A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete, formally structured list of components, libraries, and dependencies that make up a software application. It's essential for:
- Vulnerability management
- License compliance
- Supply chain security
- Regulatory compliance (e.g., Executive Order 14028)

**Dual SBOM Generation:**

#### 1. CycloneDX Format (via Trivy)
```yaml
- name: Generate SBOM with Trivy
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ github.actor }}/vardr/${{ matrix.image.name }}:latest
    format: 'cyclonedx'
    output: 'sbom-cyclonedx.json'
    command: 'fs'
```

#### 2. SPDX Format (via Syft)
```yaml
- name: Generate SBOM with Syft
  uses: anchore/sbom-action@v0
  with:
    image: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ github.actor }}/vardr/${{ matrix.image.name }}:latest
    format: spdx-json
    output-file: sbom-spdx.json
```

**SBOM Features:**
- **CycloneDX**: Industry-standard format for vulnerability management
- **SPDX**: Standard format for license compliance
- **Artifact Storage**: SBOMs are stored as GitHub artifacts for 90 days
- **Image Attachment**: SBOM is cryptographically attached to the Docker image

### üîê Cryptographic Signing

**Image Signing:**
- All images are cryptographically signed using Cosign
- Ensures image integrity and authenticity
- Supports air-gapped deployments with signature verification

**SBOM Attachment:**
```yaml
- name: Attach SBOM to image
  if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
  run: |
    cosign attach sbom --sbom sbom-cyclonedx.json ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ github.actor }}/vardr/${{ matrix.image.name }}:latest
```

### üìä Security Reporting

**GitHub Security Tab Integration:**
- Trivy scan results automatically appear in GitHub Security tab
- Enables centralized vulnerability management
- Supports automated security workflows

**Artifact Management:**
- SBOM files are stored as GitHub artifacts
- 90-day retention policy for compliance
- Downloadable for external security tools

### üõ°Ô∏è Compliance Benefits

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- **Executive Order 14028**: SBOM requirements for federal software
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Vulnerability management
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and monitoring
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

**Industry Standards:**
- **OWASP**: Security best practices
- **SLSA**: Supply chain security
- **SPDX**: License compliance
- **CycloneDX**: Vulnerability management

### üîß Usage Examples

**Viewing Security Results:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Security ‚Üí Code scanning alerts
3. View Trivy scan results and vulnerability details

**Downloading SBOM:**
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí [Workflow run]
2. Download SBOM artifacts from the workflow run
3. Use with external security tools

**Verifying Image Signatures:**
```bash
# Verify image signature
cosign verify ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ github.actor }}/vardr/spring-boot:latest

# Extract attached SBOM
cosign download sbom ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ github.actor }}/vardr/spring-boot:latest
```

### üöÄ Integration with Vardr Stack

This enhanced security pipeline aligns with the Vardr Stack's security-first approach:

- **Hardened Images**: Security scanning ensures no vulnerabilities in base images
- **Compliance Ready**: SBOM generation supports regulatory requirements
- **Air-Gapped Compatible**: Signed images and SBOMs work in offline environments
- **DevSecOps**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### üìà Next Steps

Consider implementing these additional security features:

1. **Policy Enforcement**: Add Kyverno or OPA Gatekeeper policies
2. **Secret Scanning**: Integrate with GitHub Secret scanning
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Add Dependabot for automated dependency updates
4. **Runtime Security**: Implement Falco for runtime security monitoring
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Generate compliance reports from SBOM data
